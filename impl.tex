%project goals description
We have identified the following goals for our project.
\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf The 75$\%$ goal:} 1) Porting a Tree (range lookup) and Map ( point lookup) data structure as a reliable persistent containers. 2) Implementing
			client side library routines to interact with those containers over the network. 

		\item {\bf The 100$\%$ goal:} 1) Port YCSB benchmark to work with our containers. 2) Port a state of the art kv-store (RocksDB). 
				3) Using ported YCSB benchmark client, report numbers for Blizzard containers and competing state of the art. ( RocksDB ).

\item {\bf The 125$\%$ goal:} Extend and PMWCAS to support reliability. This include design of the primive as it is not straight forward at this
		point to design it.

\end{itemize}
