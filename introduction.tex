%what is the problem
Data indexing is an important component of any practical data storage system/DBMS.
A data index essentially accelerates the read path of the data store by maintaining
fast metadata lookup for already written/stored data. However, the index itself 
needs to be persistent in addition to the stored data. Persistent index enables 
instant recovery for the DBMS as we do not have to rebuild the index from scratch.

Maintaining consistent persistent index has its own overheads. First, we have to keep 
index updated, to keep correctness between index and the data it points to. We identify
this as runtime-consistency. Next, we should make sure that, our index remain consistent
even after a unplanned system crash.That is, during index updates we have to maintain
all-or-nothing semantics by using some form of logging protocol (e.g. Aries).
